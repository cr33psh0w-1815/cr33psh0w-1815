## About Me

I am an Australian university student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in ICT. My interests span a wide range of fields, including open source projects, security, machine learning, hardware 'hacking,' and DevSecOps. I have a strong passion for continually learning more about computer science, as I believe that every day presents an opportunity to expand my knowledge.

## Projects and Collaboration

I'm interested in low-level development, ASM (x86/arm), C, Clojure, Rust, and red team attack simulation focused malware development and various other fun projects. I'm continually learning and open to collaborating on projects where I can contribute my skills. If you have any interesting projects or opportunities, feel free to connect with me.
